# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the chakoshi-api project - a guardrail service for generative AI systems. This is currently a scratch directory for initial development.

## API Documentation

The official API documentation is available at: https://docs.chakoshi.ntt.com/docs/tutorial/api

## Development Status

This is a scratch directory in the early stages of development. The actual implementation will follow the chakoshi API specification.

## Key Considerations

- This service will implement guardrails for AI systems
- Follow the chakoshi API specification when implementing endpoints
- This is a Japanese service (NTT) so documentation and comments may include Japanese text
